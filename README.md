# Overview
This project was my first assignment for my class INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web, where I designed and developed a personal website. 

The original project required creating a static, mullti-page mobile website using only HTML and CSS. There were 4 milestones in the original project: 

# Original Project Milestones
## Milestone 1: Website Topic, Audience, and Goals 
- Selected the topic for my website and identified the target audience.
- Researched example websites and analyzed their audience and goals. 
- Defined the goals of my audience and determined how the website would support them.
- Created a draft of the home page and structured the content using semantic HTML.

## Milestone 2: Styling the Home Page 
- Analyzed CSS properties used in example websites for inspiration.
- Styled a draft version of the homepage with a mobile-optimized layout. 

## Milestone 3: Multi-Page Website
- Designed the information architecture for all pages of the website.
- Coded a multi-page static website with consistent navigation and layout.

## Final Milestone: Submission
- Submitted the completed multi-page static website. 
- Documented the design journey, detailing design alternatives, decisions, and the rationale behind them while aligning with user-centered design principles.

# Post-Course Revisions
After completing the course, I revisited and revised the website to mainly:
- Make it responsive for both wide and narrow screens.
- Add interactivity using JavaScript.
- Add the "Portfolio" page
